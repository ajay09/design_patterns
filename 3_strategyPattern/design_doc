Motivation

many algo can be decomposed into higher and lower-level parts
e.g. Making a tea can be decomposed into
     - Higher-level : The process of making a hot beverage (boil water, pour into cup)
     - Lower level  : Teas-specific things (put the teabag into cup)


The high-level algo can then be reused for making other types of hot beverages (coffee or hot chocolate)
It is generic.
And to make a beverage it(the high levl algo) has to be supported by a beverage-specific strategy.


Strategy
Enables the exact behavior of a system to be selected at either run-time (dynamic) or compile-time (static).
Also known as policy.


Steps :
- Define an algo at a high level
- Define an interface for your strategies to follow
- Provide for either dynamic or static(template) composition of strategy in the high level algo
