Motivation

Consider an ordinary telephone :
What you can do with it depends on the state of the phone
	- If it's ringing or you want to make a call, you can pick it up
	- Phone must be off the hook to take/make call
	- if you are calling someone and it's busy then you put the handset down
	  or leave a message or stay on hold

Changes in state can be explicit or in response to events. (e.g. observer)
(someone is calling you and the observer pick it up)


State
A pattern in which the object's behavior is determined by its state.
An object transitions from one state to another(something needs to trigger the transition).
A formalized construct which manages states and transitions from one state to another is
called a state machine.


Can define
- State entry/exit behaviors
- Action when a particular even causes a transition
- Guard conditions enabling/disabling a transition
- Default action when no transitions are found for an even
