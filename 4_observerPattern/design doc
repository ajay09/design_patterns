Motivation

Sometimes we need to be informed when certain things happen
- Property of some object changes
- Object does something
- Some external even occurs

We want to listen to evets and be notified when they occur.

C++ has no built-in functionality for this (C# does)
Thus we need to rely on function pointer, std::funciton, OOP constructs


Observer
An observer is an object that wishes to be informed about events happening in
a system, typically by providing a callback function to call when the event
occurs.
The entity generating the events is called observable.
