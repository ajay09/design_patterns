Motivation

e.g. Power Adapter : electrical devices have different power (interface) requirements
Specially if you travel from one country to another.
	- Voltage (5V, 220V)
	- Socket/plug type

We can not modify our gadgets to support every possible interface.
Thus we usa a device(an adapter) that gives us the interface we require.


Adapter => A construct which adapts an existing interface X to conform to the required interface Y.
