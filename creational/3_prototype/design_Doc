Motivation

Coplicated objects e.g. cars aren't designed from scratch.
You already got a desgin for a car that is pretty good but then you can subsequently fine tune
things, you can install new components at certain locations and you get a better product
as a result.

You take an existing partially constructed desgin as a Prototype and then you
fine tune it.

We make a copy(clone) of the prototype and customize it.
	      (requires deep copy)

To make the cloning convenient we do it via a Factory.
