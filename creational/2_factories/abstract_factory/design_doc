Abstract Factory Design Pattern
This is used when you want to create instances of Classes that belong to some
specific set or a family. These classes are designed to work together but at a time
you should be able to use instances of Classes only from a specific set.

With Abastract clients can create instances of different classes without 
depending on their concrete types.


Set 1
has classes from A1, B1, and C1


Set 2
has classes from A2, B2, and C2

				  |``````````````````````` Factory1---------------Set1
				  |
client  ----------|
				  |
 				  |_______________________ Factory2---------------Set2


The client should get instances only from one set at a time.
