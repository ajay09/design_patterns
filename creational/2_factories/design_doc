Factory is a centralized location where things are created.

Factory Method
Factory External Class
Factory Inner Class
Abstract Factory


Motivation
 - Object creation logic becomes too convoluted
 - Constructor is not descriptive
 	- Name mandated by name of containing type
 	- Cannot overload with same sets of arguments with different names
 	- can turn into 'optional parameter hell'
 - Objet creation (non-piecewise, unlike Builder) can be outsourced to
 	- A separate function (Factory Method)
 	- A separate class (Factory)
 	- A hierarchy of classes with Abstract Factory


Factory  =>  is a separate component responsible solely for the creation of objects (not piecewise).

Factory Method => A function that helps create objects. Like a constructor
                  but more descriptive.

Abstract Factory  =>  a factory construct used to construct object in hierarchies.
