After encapsulting Guitar and GuitarSpec let's make Inventory well designed.

New Requirement
Now we want to be able to sell 12 strings guitar.

For this we have to add a new attribuite and a new method in GuitarSpec, say numStrings and getNumStrings()
This would inturn mean modification in the search method of Inventory
This is undesirable!


We need to encapsulate the guitar specifications and isolate them from the rest of the guitar search tool.
- Change search() method in Inventory to "delegate" comparing two GuitarSpec objects instead of handling
   the comparison directly.
