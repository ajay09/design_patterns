The current version is not working expectedly =>
        the guitar being searched is there is the inventory. Still we are not getting results.
        

This is because the way in which we are comparing the guitar properties.
Since we are comparing string and upper and lower case strings are considered different.
Thus our comparision is failing.
        "fender"  ==  "Fender"   =>  False
        

We can have 2 solutions for this issue:
 - Use case-insensitive string comparision.
 - Use enum in place of string and avoid string comparision.
 
Avoiding string comparision using enum would be a better choice.
This avoids the headache of ensuring that string comparisions are case-insensitive all the time.

The most important benefit of using enum is that
classes and methods that use them are protected
from any values not defined in the enum.
A misspelling will give a compiler error.
Thus it provides not only 'type safety' but also 'value safety'.
