Design patterns are common architectural approaches.

SOLID

Single Responsibility (SRP)
	A class should only have a single responsibility

Open-closed Principle (OCP)
	Entities should be open for extension but closed for modification

Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
	Objects should be replaceable with instances of their subtyes without altering program correctness

Interface setregation (ISP)
	Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface

Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
	Dependencies should be abstract rather than concrete
